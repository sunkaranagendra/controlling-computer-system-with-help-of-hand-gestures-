# controlling-computer-system-with-help-of-hand-gestures-
uman Machine Interface or HMI is a system comprising of hardware and software that helps in communication and exchange of information between the user (human operator) and the machine.We normally use LED Indicators, Switches, Touch Screens and LCD Displays as a part of HMI devices. Another way to communicate with machines like Robots or Computers is with the help of Hand Gestures.Instead of using a keyboard, mouse or joystick, we can use our hand gestures to control certain functions of a computer like play/pause a video, move left/right in a photo slide show, scroll up/down in a web page and many more. In this project, we have implemented a simple Arduino based hand gesture control where you can control few functions of your web browser like switching between tabs, scrolling up and down in web pages, shift between tasks (applications), play or pause a video and increase or decrease the volume (in VLC Player) with the help of hand gestures.
